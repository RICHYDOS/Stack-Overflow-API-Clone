# Stack-Overflow-API-Clone

During this project, I set out to create a backend API that would mirror some of the core functionalities of the Stack Overflow website. 
It was an exciting challenge that allowed me to explore the Sequelize CLI, which proved to be an incredibly useful tool for building the API. I also learned a great deal about the associations between models and the special methods or functions that come with them.

One of the most significant takeaways from this project was the opportunity to expand my knowledge of Git. 
I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the Git CLI, and I learned how to handle Git requests such as push and pull. I also experimented with Git branches, which was a new experience for me.

Finally, I was able to dive into TypeScript and learn more about interfaces and type annotations. This was an excellent opportunity to improve my knowledge of the language and learn how to use it effectively in my programming projects.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience.
